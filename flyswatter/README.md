<h1>Project 1</h1>

<p>For this assignment I created a simple game where the user clicks to squash a fly. This was the easiest way to me to fulfill the projects needs by including something interactive. I didn't have any fun doing this though. I don't know if it was because there were several new things I had to confront like loading images and having complete control over every variable and object. I also talk about it in my paper, but I don't like how this project doesn't really have any art or any meaning. So I had an oddly rough time with it. I have ideas for other things so hopefully this is just a rough stone on the path to better things.

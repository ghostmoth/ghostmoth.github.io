<h1>HW 10-1 post</h1>

<p>For some reason, I had such a hard time with this project. A part of the problem I think is I just didn't choose very interesting information to do something with. So I had a hard time deciding what interesting way to portray the information. Thus, my sketch just isn't interesting, but if you ask me it only reflects the information. I just displayed different amounts per year by accessing the JSON. I tried to incorporate a forloop to access the separate arrays in the JSON, but I only got an unknown message. I also tried to shorten my code with the various amounts from the first array but the amounts in the first array aren't in their own array, they're their own objects so I didn't know how to access them without writing all separate lines of code. I don't know, I just didn't know what to do with this information. I'll be sure to pick something more interesting next time.</p>

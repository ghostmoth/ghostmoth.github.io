<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

<p> For this final project I want to accomplish a choreographed digital dance to whatever song I choose using geometric shapes, patterns, and movements. It should hopefully represent the moving story and mood that the song shows, without any blatant words or organic shapes. A story through movement.

Sub Problems
Goodness, I'm sure I'll have several problems. I expect to probably use some timers and boundaries and those were already an issue with Pac-man so they will definitely be an issue here. Generating all the shapes to do what I want when I want to the music will be a problem.



General Work-Schedule

14th November - propose project and start research on how to generate multiple shapes and patterns and decide on a final song to work off of.
18th November - Have physical drawings and basic idea of how I'm going to do this and what it will look like to refer to in the upcoming weeks
28th November - Have a rough cut done by this day to then add detail and more where it needs it
5th December - In class test testing and feedback
12th December - Present

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>so I tried to make a sort of sun with shooting stars to go behind it. I wasn't quite sure how to put a boundary on the colors so its just kind of random colors. I would've liked to just make it variations of reds, oranges, and yellows but, again, I just didn't know how to make that happen. I also struggled with animation. I didn't understand that I would have to set my top variable to 0 before adding 1. I eventually got it and it worked. That was truly the only hardest part. Otherwise, I am sort of understanding random functions and tried to incorporate it in my work and had something, but I wasn't happy with it. Overall this project was fairly well taken, just with a couple bumps in the road.  .</p>

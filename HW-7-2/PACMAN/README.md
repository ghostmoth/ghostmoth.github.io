<h1>Pacman blog post</h1>

<p>Goodness Gracious. I have never had a more frustrating and seemingly impossible homework assignment. Even with the week extension I still could not get everything done that needed to be done. I worked with Kyle from the other class on this project for a long time and even our two heads put together couldn't figure some things out. Some of my misunderstanding is my fault. My irrational fear of asking for help and my want to figure it out myself kept me from going to office hours more. Along with me always having class during office hours. I honestly, in the nicest way, don't think we were ready for this kind of project. We had not been taught some concepts that would've helped in this project. I had the hardest time with mouth animation and boundaries of all kind. I consulted the internet but even it had a hard time explaining how to fix my problems. I tried a lot of different things but none seemed to work well with my code. I'm frustrated by this project and have never felt more stupid. But, as I look at all the others we all seemed to have similar problems so it's probably not just me. Also I believe, currently, when the pacman go off the screen, there are boundaries and they come back eventually.</p>

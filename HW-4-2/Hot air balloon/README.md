<p> Ok, so for this project I created a simple hot air balloon with some clouds behind it. The original idea was to have the balloon go across the page, but I didn't know how to make the whole shape move together. So, I decided to make the clouds move, which still give the illusion of a floating balloon. My issue with this is I can make a shape move but I can't make it redraw, the shape just copies itself. I followed tutorials to a t and their shapes don't have tails but mine do. For the mouse click part, when you click on the balloon it changes color. I had no issue with this, except I kind of wanted it to click to a random color every time but what I tried didn't work so I stuck with the one color change. Otherwise I didn't have a ton of issue with this project, most of the time it's pretty straight forward.  .</p>

<h1>FINAL PROJECT</h1>

<p> Thus ends the journey, stained with blood sweat and tears. This turned more into a narrative rather than a piece of designs and patters.
It makes it more simple and more realistic to achieve in the time give/ the time I devoted to it. The paper goes into more detail about that.
It may not look like a lot of work, and maybe to someone else it isn't, but for me this took so much time, so hopefully it is well received.
